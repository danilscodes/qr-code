## My process

1. HTML base layout
2. add CSS

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

learned about landmark tags
learned not to limit heights on elements, use min-height
learned to use max-width with rem on my container, not width
learned more about flexbox
refreshed on media queries for responsiveness

center div in middle of page:

```css
.body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 100vh;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
